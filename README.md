## Features
- Obscures text that won't be seen in game.
- Only colours strings in code files (JavaScript and TypeScript).
- Colours whole document in plaintext files.

## Commands
Adds 2 commands `Hackmud Color: Enable` and `Hackmud Color: Disable` which enable and disable the extension on the fly.

## Extension Settings

Adds `hackmud-color.enable` which enables or disables the extension.

## Known Issues
Commented code is coloured. Not a breaking bug, just an oversight that makes some test look weird.
